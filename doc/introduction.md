# Introduction

## The OSCAR platform

OSCAR is a cloud based web application for digital decision support and allows for the integration and analysis of datasets for emergency preparedness and response.

## About

The adequate use of information is essential in health crises and other emergencies to react quickly and appropriately and to use limited resources efficiently and effectively. Nevertheless, this task often falls short - data is simply missing, hidden in printouts, cannot be combined, or cannot be used for deriving indicators and preparing decision making. 

The solution: OSCAR is able to easily integrate multiple data sources via APIs, collect the data, provides the possibility to perform calculations on this data to derive KPIs for decision making, and provide end users with an intuitive UI to work with the data. 

Our vision is to make it both easy to set up (no coding - just configuration) and easy to use.

We believe that OSCAR adds value by enabling a better coordinated and more effective support when faced with emergencies. In addition, it offers large potentials for routine planning processes in various sectors of development cooperation.
